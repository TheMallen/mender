Bender is a class that does a simple but very useful thing: it combines your CSS / Javascripts into one file (one for CSS and one for Javascript),
then minimizes these files on the fly. It makes your site load faster due to reduced number of HTTP requests. It also reduces server load and traffic.
Bender is written in pure PHP and can be used even on very restricted shared hostings. It does not require any other technology, such as Java or Python.
